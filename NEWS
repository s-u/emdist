0.3-1	2012-11-30
    o	make base distance modular with fast implementations of
	"euclidean" and "manhattan". Allow arbitrary closures
	as distances (much slower).

    o	change the original code to use dynamically allocated
	memory instead of the stack - this removes the arbitrary
	limit of signature sizes.


0.2-1	2011-04-12
    o	first open-source release based on Yossi Rubner's code
	plus extrapolation (as used in our route matching paper)
