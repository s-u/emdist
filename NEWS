    o	make maximum number of iterations a configurable option

    o	allow override of FDIM at compile-time if more than 4
	dimensions are required; e.g.: PKG_CPPFLAGS=-DFDIM=10

    o	fix eval() protection bug when custom distance function
	is used (thanks to Tomáš Kalibera)


0.3-1	2012-11-30
    o	make base distance modular with fast implementations of
	"euclidean" and "manhattan". Allow arbitrary closures
	as distances (much slower).

    o	change the original code to use dynamically allocated
	memory instead of the stack - this removes the arbitrary
	limit of signature sizes.


0.2-1	2011-04-12
    o	first open-source release based on Yossi Rubner's code
	plus extrapolation (as used in our route matching paper)
